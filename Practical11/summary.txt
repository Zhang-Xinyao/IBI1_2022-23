After running code, it was found that the alignment score of amino acids sequence for human gene and mouse gene, human gene and cat gene, mouse gene and cat gene were 3579, 3717 and 3592 respectively. When focusing on the percentage of identical amino acids for these genes, it was shown that the percentage for human gene and mouse gene, human gene and cat gene, mouse gene and cat gene were 82.111801%, 85.217391% and 81.739130% respectively. According to the above data, we could conclude that the human sequence and cat sequence are mostly related for their highest alignment score and percentage of identical amino acids. Species with highly similar sequence may have the same ancestral sequence. The structure and functional proteins also have something in common in these species. By studying the proteins in cats and the characteristics of cats, we can recognize the functions of proteins in human body more easily and get more therapies for protein dysfunction to develop human well-being.
