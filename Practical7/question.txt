How many total cases and total deaths developed during December 31st in 2019 to March 28th in 2020 in Australia?(emphasize every 4 days on x axis)
I start to answer this question from line 56.
The result satisfies my expectations.
I used "loc" to get the column with title of "total_cases" and "total_deaths".
"b+" was used to color the points of "total_cases" in blue and "r+" was used to color the points of "total_deaths" in red
"Australia_dates.iloc[0:len(Australia_dates):4]" was used to get the dates every 4 days after December 27th in 2019
